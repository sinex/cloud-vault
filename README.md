Automated deployment of Vaultwarden to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure


Features:

- Vaultwarden instance behind a Caddy proxy
- Automatic Cloudflare DNS records
- Cloudflare-integrated fail2ban
- Provisioned on Always-Free tier OCI resources
- Backups to an existing borg repository

## Requirements

### Dependencies
- make
- jq
- terraform
- ansible
- docker

### Resources
- Github
  - Personal Access Token with `write:packages` scope (for pushing images)
  - Personal Access Token with `delete:packages` scope (for CI image cleanup)
  - Personal Access Token with `repo` scope (for Terraform to add secrets)
- Cloudflare
  - API Token with `Zone.DNS` scope (for Terraform to add DNS records)
  - API Token with `Firewall Services:Edit` and `Firewall Services:Read` scope (for fail2ban)
- Terraform Cloud workspace
- SSH Key for use with Ansible and for local administrative actions


## Configuration

Environment variables configured in `.env` need to be available in the deployment environment.
It's recommended to use a tool such as `direnv` or `dotenv` to manage this automatically.

An example file is included in this repo for all configuration
```shell
cp .env.example .env
cp terraform/terraform.tfvars.example terraform/terraform.tfvars
```


### Infrastructure configuration

Configuration of infrastructure resources is handled by Terraform variables.
This project has been designed with using Terraform Cloud in mind, so any variables set here can also be set in the Terraform Cloud console.

Create an SSH key which will be used for deployment operations:
```shell
make deploy-key
```

```terraform
# terraform/terraform.tfvars

# OCI config
oci_tenancy_ocid     = "ocid1.tenancy.oc1.."
oci_user_ocid        = "ocid1.user.oc1.."
oci_compartment_ocid = "ocid1.tenancy.oc1.."
oci_api_fingerprint  = "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx"
oci_api_private_key  = <<EOF
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
EOF

# API Token with Zone.DNS scope
cloudflare_api_token = "..."

# Domain zone where DNS records will be created
cloudflare_zone      = "example.com"

# Name of the repository hosting this code
github_repository = "cloud-vault"

# Personal Access Token with "repo" scope
github_token      = ""

# User-provided SSH public key. Will be used for both the 'admin' and 'deployer' accounts
admin_ssh_public_key = "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC..."

# Deploy key generated by `make deploy-key
deploy_ssh_private_key = "LS0tLS1CRUdJTiB...."
```

_See `terraform/terraform.tfvars.example` for a description of all available configuration options_


### Deployment configuration

```shell
# .env

# Terraform Cloud organisation
TF_CLOUD_ORGANIZATION=

# Terraform Cloud workspace
TF_WORKSPACE=
```


### Application configuration

```shell
# .env

# FQDN for the deployed instance
FQDN=vault.example.com

# Email address for LetsEncrypt registration and Vaultwarden invite sending
VAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com

# Organisation name to use in vaultwarden
VAULT_ORG_NAME=Vaultwarden

# Vaultwarden SMTP settings
VAULT_SMTP_HOST=localhost
VAULT_SMTP_PORT=587
VAULT_SMTP_SECURITY=starttls
VAULT_SMTP_USERNAME=username
VAULT_SMTP_PASSWORD=password

# Cloudflare Token for fail2ban (requires "Zone.Firewall Services" scope)
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=

# Cloudflare Zone ID where firewalls rules ill be created
CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID=
```

### Backup configuration

This stack uses `borg` to automatically create backups.
On startup, the borg container will automatically restore the latest backup if no existing data is found.

If the path defined by `BORG_REPO` does not contain an initialised repository,
then it will be initialised using `borg init --encryption repokey`

__If you already have an existing repository and private key, then skip these steps and add the relevant details to `.env`__


```shell
# Generate a new passphrase. Save this to BORG_PASSPHRASE in .env
head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64

# Generate a new SSH keypair. Add the new value to .env as BORG_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY
make borg-key

# Add the new public key to the authorized_keys file on the server
cat keys/borg.pub | ssh user@backups.example.com -- "cat - >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

Example borg configuration:

```shell
# .env

# Borg backup repository path. The format must remain as given in the example
BORG_REPO=ssh://user@backups.example.com:22/./vault

# Plain text passphrase for the borg repo.
BORG_PASSPHRASE=cXfddDb1TOhK...nxkuWw3E9004=

# Base64 encoded SSH private key used to connect to borg remote
BORG_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY=LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBPUEVOU1NII...ZXPUEVOU1NIIFBSSVZBVEUgS0VZLS0tLS0K
```

_See `.env.example` for a description of all available environment variables_


## Deployment

Deployment of the application stack happens in 4 stages:
1. Resource provisioning
1. Host configuration
1. Application deployment
1. Application configuration


### 1. Resource provisioning

This executes Terraform and provisions the required resources in Oracle Cloud

```shell
make infra-create
```

### 2. Host configuration

This executes Ansible against the newly created host, and is responsible for installation of required packages
as well as injecting Docker secrets.

_Any time the values in `.env` or `vaultwarden.env` change, this step must be run again!_

```shell
make infra-configure
```


### 3. Application deployment

Once the host is up and configured, the application is ready to deploy.
This will run `docker stack deploy` and afterwards, the application should be available.

```shell
make app-deploy
```

### 4. Application configuration

In order to access the Vaultwarden `/admin` endpoint, a random `ADMIN_TOKEN` variable needs to be set.
The following make target handles creation of a new token and automates restarting the stack.
The application will be restarted without an `ADMIN_TOKEN` once again when configuration is complete.

```shell
make app-configure
```

## Github CD configuration

There are two CD workflows:
- `cd-build.yml` is executed on push to `master`
- `cd-deploy.yml` is additionally executed on push to and branch starting with `deploy-`


There are two GitHub tokens which are required for deployment to succeed:

### 1. Token with `repo` scope

Terraform requires this in order to write GitHub action secrets.

Define these variables locally or in Terraform Cloud:
```terraform
# terraform.tfvars
github_repository = "cloud-vault"
github_token      = "nCbZafeYI...Dvqrrhyv"
```

### 2. Token with `delete:package` scope

The build action requires this in order to delete old containers from the registry

Define the following GitHub Secret with the value of the token:

- `DELETE_PACKAGES_TOKEN`

### Automatic Secrets 

The following are automatically created/updated by Terraform:
- `DEPLOYER_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `DEPLOYER_USERNAME`
- `PRIMARY_INSTANCE_IP`
